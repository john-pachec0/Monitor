**Last Updated:** January 13, 2025
**Effective Date:** January 13, 2025

## Our Privacy Commitment

Monitor is built with your privacy as the foundation. This isn't just a policy—it's how we designed the app from the ground up. Your eating disorder recovery journey, meal tracking, emotions, and health data belong to you, and only you.

## Information We Do NOT Collect

We want to be crystal clear about what we don't do:

- ❌ **No account creation** - You don't create an account or sign in
- ❌ **No cloud storage** - Your data never leaves your device
- ❌ **No tracking** - We don't track what you do in the app
- ❌ **No analytics** - We don't collect usage statistics or behavior data
- ❌ **No advertising** - No ad networks, no ad tracking, no third parties
- ❌ **No personal information** - We don't collect your name, email, or contact info
- ❌ **No location data** - We don't access your location
- ❌ **No identifiers** - No device IDs, advertising IDs, or user tracking
- ❌ **No cookies or web beacons** - The app doesn't use any tracking technology

## How Your Data is Stored

**All data stays on your device.** Here's what that means:

### SwiftData Local Storage
- Your meal entries, photos, emotions, and recovery notes are stored using Apple's SwiftData framework
- This data is stored in a local database on your iPhone or iPad
- The database is encrypted at rest using iOS's built-in device encryption
- This data is included in your iCloud Backup or iTunes Backup (if you have those enabled)
- If you delete the app, all data is permanently deleted

### User Settings
- Your preferences (review time, notification settings, care team information) are stored locally
- Settings persist across app launches but never leave your device

### No Server, No Cloud
- Monitor does not have a backend server for user data
- There is no cloud sync, no server-side storage, no remote access
- Your data cannot be accessed by us, law enforcement, or anyone else
- We cannot recover your data if you lose your device

## Notifications (Local Only)

If you enable notifications:
- Notifications are scheduled locally on your device using iOS's UserNotifications framework
- No data is sent to Apple or any server to deliver notifications
- You can disable notifications anytime in Settings
- Notification content is generated on your device

## Data Security

While we don't collect data, we still take security seriously:

### On-Device Security
- All data is encrypted at rest using iOS Data Protection (hardware encryption)
- If you have a passcode or Face ID/Touch ID enabled, your data is further protected
- Data is sandboxed within the app—other apps cannot access it
- Memory is cleared when the app closes

### No Breach Risk
- Since we don't collect your mental health data, it cannot be breached
- There are no user accounts to compromise
- There are no passwords to leak
- Your data stays with you, under your control

## Your Rights

### Access
- You have full access to all your data within the app
- Navigate to the Journal to see all your meal entries
- View your meal history organized by date
- Review any entry at any time

### Deletion
- Delete individual entries: Swipe left on any meal entry in the Journal
- Delete all data: Uninstall the app (Settings → General → iPhone Storage → Monitor → Delete App)
- Once deleted, data cannot be recovered (we don't have backups)

### Export
- Export your data as PDF from Settings → Export Data
- Share with your care team, therapist, or dietitian
- PDF includes all meal entries, behaviors, and emotions
- This is your data—you should be able to take it with you

### Portability
- Your data is stored in open formats (SwiftData/SQLite)
- Technically savvy users can access the database file in backups
- Official PDF export is available now

## Children's Privacy

Monitor is intended for individuals 13 years and older. We do not knowingly collect information from children under 13. Since we don't collect any personal information at all, parental supervision is recommended for minors using the app for eating disorder recovery support.

## Third-Party Services

**We use NO third-party services.** No analytics, no crash reporting, no ad networks, no backend servers, nothing.

Monitor is completely self-contained on your device.

## Changes to This Policy

If we update this privacy policy:
- We'll update the "Last Updated" date at the top
- We'll notify you within the app (if the change is material)
- Continued use of the app means you accept the updated policy
- You can always review this policy at [URL where you'll host it]

We will never:
- Change the fundamental privacy-first nature of Monitor
- Start collecting personal data or mental health data
- Introduce tracking or analytics without your explicit consent
- Sell or share your data with third parties

## Data Processing Location

- **Your health data:** Stays on your iPhone or iPad (wherever you are)
- **No server storage:** We have no servers, so there's no data processing location

## Legal Basis (GDPR Compliance)

Monitor doesn't collect personal data, so GDPR doesn't technically apply. However, we follow GDPR principles anyway:

- **Data minimization** - We collect nothing
- **Purpose limitation** - N/A (no collection)
- **Storage limitation** - Data stays on your device, you control retention
- **Transparency** - This policy clearly explains everything
