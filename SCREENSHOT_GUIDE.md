1. **Hook** - Privacy promise (unique value)
2. **Capture** - Show ease of use
3. **Store** - Show worry box concept
4. **Review** - Show CBT process
5. **Reframe** - Show transformation
6. **Learn** - Show depth
7. **Track** - Show long-term value (optional)
8. **Customize** - Show control (optional)

**Users decide in 3-5 screenshots** whether to download, so front-load the most important ones.

## Examples to Avoid

**DON'T:**
- Show empty screens (looks incomplete)
- Use Lorem Ipsum or placeholder text
- Show debug menus or test data
- Include version numbers or "beta" labels
- Show error messages or bugs
- Use low-quality images
- Violate Apple's screenshot guidelines

**DO:**
- Show realistic use cases

- Highlight unique features (privacy!)
- Make text readable even at small sizes
- Test how they look in App Store search (thumbnail view)

---

## Testing Your Screenshots

Before finalizing:

1. **View at thumbnail size**
   - First screenshot appears tiny in search results
   - Can you tell what the app does?
   - Is privacy message clear?

2. **Show to someone unfamiliar**
   - Do they understand what the app does?
   - Does it look trustworthy?
   - Would they download it?

3. **Check on different devices**
   - How does it look on iPad? (if offering iPad version)
   - How does it look on Mac App Store?

4. **Compare to competitors**
   - How do your screenshots compare to other CBT apps?
   - Do you stand out?
   - Is privacy message prominent?

---

## Localiz

ation (Future)

When you localize to other languages:
- Screenshots should be re-created with localized text
- Captions translated
- Example thoughts culturally appropriate
- Can use same device frames

---

## Updating Screenshots

You can update screenshots anytime without submitting a new app version.

**When to update:**
- After significant UI changes
- When adding new features
- If user feedback suggests confusion
- To test different messaging (A/B testing with phased releases)

**Best practice:** Keep screenshots current with latest app version

---

## Next Steps

1. **Take screenshots** from iPhone simulator (Cmd+S)
2. **Add device frames** using one of the tools above
3. **Add captions** that tell the app's story
4. **Export at correct sizes** (1290x2796 and 1242x2208)
5. **Upload to App Store Connect** in the order above
