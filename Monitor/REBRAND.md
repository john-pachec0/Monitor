## Key Messages to Remember

### Tagline
**"Monitor your thoughts"**

### Elevator Pitch
"Monitor helps you identify cognitive distortions and reframe anxious thoughts using CBT. Based on David Burns' 'Feeling Good' framework."

### One-Liner (for friends)
"It's like having a CBT-trained friend in your pocket who helps you catch distorted thinking."

### Differentiators
1. ⚡ **Fast**: Capture in 5 seconds
2. 🧠 **Smart**: Learns your patterns (Phase 2)
3. 🔒 **Private**: Local-only, no cloud
4. 🤝 **Supportive**: Warm tone, not clinical
5. 📖 **Authentic**: True to David Burns' framework

## What's Different About "Monitor" vs "Clarity"

### Clarity (Old)
- Generic name (many apps called "Clarity")
- Could be anything (productivity, meditation, etc.)
- No connection to CBT framework
- Less memorable

### Monitor (New)
- ✅ **Unique** in mental health space
- ✅ **Specific** to cognitive reframing
- ✅ **Authentic** to David Burns' terminology
- ✅ **Active verb** - empowering
- ✅ **Visual metaphor** - easy to explain
- ✅ **Memorable** - unusual word

## Testing Checklist

Once you build in Xcode, verify:

- [ ] App name shows "Monitor" in simulator
- [ ] Navigation bar says "Monitor"
- [ ] Empty state says "Welcome to Monitor"
- [ ] Empty state says "Monitor it together" (not "reframe")
- [ ] All screens work (capture, review, complete)
- [ ] Data persists after force quit

## Quick Win: Update Your Computer

You can quickly test the name change:

```bash
cd /home/claude/Monitor
grep -r "Clarity" . --exclude-dir=.git

# Should return very few results (mostly in this doc!)
```

---

## Questions?

### "Can I still change the name?"
Yes! It's just find/replace. But I'd commit to "Monitor" - it's strong.

### "Do I need to change the color scheme?"
No! The warm terracotta works perfectly with "Monitor."

### "What about the icon?"
Think: tangled line → straight line. Keep it simple. Terracotta on white.

### "Should I trademark it?"
Eventually, yes. But launch first, validate demand, then invest in trademark.

### "When do I need the domain?"
Not immediately, but register soon. Landing page can wait until you're closer to launch.
