## Your Brand in a Nutshell

**Name**: Monitor  
**Domain**: Monitor.app (available!)  
**Tagline**: "Monitor your thoughts"  

**What it does**: Helps you identify cognitive distortions and reframe anxious thoughts using CBT (based on David Burns' "Feeling Good")

**How it's different**:
- ⚡ Ultra-fast capture (< 5 seconds)
- 🧠 Pattern recognition (learns from YOUR past reframes)
- 🔒 Truly private (local-only, no cloud)
- 🤝 Warm & supportive (not clinical)
- 📖 Authentic to David Burns' framework

---

## Technical Highlights

- **iOS 17+** only (modern SwiftUI + SwiftData)
- **Zero dependencies** (no CocoaPods, no SPM)
- **Local-first** (complete privacy)
- **Warm design** (terracotta, cream, rounded fonts)
- **Clean architecture** (testable, maintainable)

---

## What Works ✅

1. **Fast Thought Capture**
   - Text input with auto-focus
   - Saves locally instantly
   - Dismisses to home

2. **5-Step Guided Review**
   - Read your thought
   - Rate anxiety before (1-10)
   - Identify distortions (5 types with examples)
   - Write reframe
   - Rate anxiety after
   - Celebration & insights

3. **Thought History**
   - See all captured thoughts
   - Visual indicators (reviewed vs. unreviewed)
   - Tap to review anytime

4. **Cognitive Distortions**
   - All-or-Nothing Thinking
   - Catastrophizing
   - Mind Reading
   - Fortune Telling
   - Should Statements
   - Each with description + example + info sheet

---

## What's NOT Built Yet (Intentionally)

We kept the MVP focused. Phase 2 will add:

- Pattern detection (similar past thoughts)
- Suggested reframes (ML-powered)
- Weekly insights & trends
- Scheduled review notifications
- Onboarding flow
- Settings screen
- Voice input
- Dark mode
- Export for therapy

---

## Validation Checklist

Before moving to Phase 2, validate:

- [ ] Does the core flow feel good?
- [ ] Is capture actually fast enough?
- [ ] Does the review process help?
- [ ] Is the tone right (supportive, not clinical)?
- [ ] Would you actually use this daily?
- [ ] Does it reduce anxiety in practice?

If yes to all → Phase 2. If not → iterate on MVP.

**Empty State**:  
"Welcome to Monitor. When an anxious thought arises, capture it here. Later, you'll review and Monitor it together."

**After Capture**:  
"Got it. We'll look at this together when you're ready."

**During Review**:  
"Let's look at this thought together. Does this sound familiar?"

**After Complete**:  
"You're building the skill of noticing and reframing distorted thoughts. Each time you practice, it gets easier."

## Final Thoughts

You're building something that could **genuinely help people** the way "Feeling Good" helped you. 

The combination of:
- Personal experience (you know CBT works)
- Real pain point (existing tools were frictionful)
- Clear differentiation (reframing-first, pattern learning)
- Privacy-first approach (users will trust this)
- Authentic branding (true to David Burns)

...means Monitor has real potential.

**The vertical slice proves the concept.**  
**Now it's about validation and iteration.**

Build it. Test it. See if it helps. Then we'll build Phase 2 together.
