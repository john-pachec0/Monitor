PRIVACY-FIRST ANXIETY RELIEF

Your anxious thoughts belong to you, not a company's servers. Monitor is built differently—everything stays on your device. No accounts, no cloud sync, no tracking. Just you and evidence-based cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) techniques.

WHAT IS Monitor?

Monitor helps you capture and reframe anxious thoughts using proven CBT methods. When anxiety strikes, quickly capture the thought. Later, during your scheduled "worry time," review and reframe it using techniques from cognitive behavioral therapy.

KEY FEATURES

• Quick Capture
  When anxiety hits, capture the thought in seconds. Don't let it spiral—just write it down and move on with your day.

• Scheduled Review Time
  Set your "worry time" for when it works best (evenings work well). Postponing review often reduces anxiety naturally—many worries lose intensity over time.

• Guided Reframing
  Step-by-step process helps you:
  - Identify cognitive distortions in your thinking
  - Challenge unhelpful thought patterns
  - Create balanced, realistic reframes
  - Track how your anxiety changes

• Learn CBT Techniques
  Understand the 13 cognitive distortions with clear explanations, real-world examples, and practical reframing tips. Learn to spot patterns in your thinking.

• Worry Box
  Your private collection of captured thoughts, ready for review when the time is right. Think of it as a holding space for anxiety.

• Pattern Recognition
  Over time, notice patterns in your worries. See which cognitive distortions you tend toward, and build awareness of your thinking habits.

PRIVACY YOU CAN TRUST

• ✓ All data stays on your device
• ✓ No account required
• ✓ No cloud sync or backups
• ✓ No tracking or analytics
• ✓ No advertising
• ✓ Encrypted at rest with iOS device encryption
• ✓ We can't access your data—even if we wanted to

Your thoughts, reframes, and mental health data never leave your iPhone. We built Monitor this way intentionally because privacy matters, especially for mental health.

WHY POSTPONE WORRY?

Research shows that scheduling worry time (rather than worrying constantly) can reduce overall anxiety. Benefits include:

• Many worries resolve themselves or become less intense
• You can give worries focused attention rather than scattered rumination
• You're not interrupted by anxiety throughout the day
• You build a healthier relationship with anxious thoughts

BASED ON COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY

CBT is one of the most researched and effective approaches for anxiety. Monitor helps you practice core CBT skills:

• Thought awareness - Notice when anxiety shows up
• Cognitive restructuring - Challenge and reframe thoughts
• Pattern recognition - Identify thinking traps
• Evidence evaluation - Separate thoughts from facts

THIS IS NOT THERAPY

Monitor is a self-help tool, not a replacement for professional mental health care. If you're experiencing severe anxiety, depression, or thoughts of self-harm, please reach out to a mental health professional.

PERFECT FOR

• Anyone experiencing anxious thoughts
• People learning CBT techniques
• Therapy clients practicing between sessions
• Privacy-conscious users who want control over their mental health data
• People who want to try CBT before committing to therapy

WHY WE BUILT THIS

Mental health data is incredibly sensitive. Yet most apps sync it to the cloud, create accounts, and track everything you do. We built Monitor because we believe your thoughts belong to you—not to servers, not to companies, not to anyone else.

EVIDENCE-BASED & TRANSPARENT

Monitor is based on established CBT research and principles. We're transparent about what the app does (and doesn't do), and we'll never make exaggerated claims about results.

Download Monitor and start reframing anxious thoughts in complete privacy.

## SEO & Discovery Strategy

**App Store Optimization (ASO) Tips:**

1. **Title matters most**
   - Include "CBT" (searchable term)
   - "Thought Journal" is less competitive than "anxiety app"
   - "Monitor" is unique, memorable

2. **Subtitle is secondary ranking**
   - "Privacy-first" differentiates
   - "anxiety relief" is searchable

3. **Keywords drive search**
   - Don't repeat words from title/subtitle in keywords
   - Use all 100 characters
   - Focus on what users search for

4. **Description first 170 characters are critical**
   - Lead with unique value (privacy)
   - Front-load important keywords
   - Make it compelling

5. **Ratings & reviews boost ranking**
   - Encourage happy users to review
   - Respond to all reviews
   - Fix issues users mention

6. **Update regularly**
   - Frequent updates signal active development
   - Each update resets "What's New" to top
   - Can update promotional text anytime

---

## Localization (Future)

**v1.0:** English only

**Future considerations:**
- Spanish (large US market)
- French, German (Europe)
- Japanese (Asia)
- Portuguese (Brazil)

**What to localize:**
- App Store metadata (description, keywords, screenshots)
- In-app text (all UI strings)
- Educational content (distortion guides)
- Crisis resources (country-specific)

---

## Pricing

**Free** (no in-app purchases in v1.0)

**Future monetization options (if needed):**
- One-time purchase for Pro features ($4.99-$9.99)
- Donation/tip jar
- Export/backup features

**Why free:**
- Mental health tools should be accessible
- Build user base first
- Prove value before charging
- Privacy-first model reduces operating costs
