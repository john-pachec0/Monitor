# Monitor - Brand Guide

## Brand Essence

**Name**: Monitor  
**Domain**: Monitor.app  
**Tagline**: "Monitor your thoughts"

### The Name Story

"Monitor" comes directly from David Burns' "Feeling Good," where he describes anxious thinking as "twisted thinking" or "cognitive distortions." Our app helps you literally **Monitor** these distorted thought patterns.

**Why it works**:
- ✅ Authentic to CBT framework (Burns' terminology)
- ✅ Active verb (you're doing something)
- ✅ Visual metaphor (tangled → straight)
- ✅ Unique in mental health app space
- ✅ One word, memorable
- ✅ Clear benefit (Monitor = untangle = clarity)

## Brand Positioning

### What We Are
A **CBT thought-reframing companion** that helps you identify cognitive distortions and create balanced perspectives.

### What We're NOT
- ❌ A mood tracker (we care about thoughts, not just feelings)
- ❌ A meditation app (we're cognitive, not mindfulness-only)  
- ❌ A crisis tool (we complement therapy, don't replace it)
- ❌ A journaling app (we guide structured CBT, not free-form writing)
- ❌ Gamified wellness (no streaks, points, or cartoon characters)

### How We're Different

**vs. MindShift, Moodnotes, Sanvello**:
- 🎯 **Reframing-first**: Not just capturing thoughts, actively Monitoring them
- 🧠 **Pattern learning**: Shows you similar past thoughts and what helped
- ⚡ **Ultra-fast capture**: < 5 seconds to save a thought
- 🔒 **Truly private**: Local-only, no accounts, no cloud
- 🤝 **Informed friend tone**: Not clinical, not cutesy - just supportive

**Core Insight**: Other apps help you *track* anxiety. We help you *transform* it.
