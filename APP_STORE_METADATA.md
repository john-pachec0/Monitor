PRIVACY-FIRST NUTRITION TRACKING

Your eating patterns belong to you, not a company's servers. Monitor is built differently—everything stays on your device. No accounts, no cloud sync, no tracking. Just you and a simple tool for mindful eating awareness.

WHAT IS Monitor?

Monitor helps you track meals and build awareness around eating patterns and behaviors. Log what you ate, how you felt, and any behaviors you want to monitor. Over time, recognize patterns and emotional connections to food in a mindful, non-judgmental way.

KEY FEATURES

• Quick Meal Logging
  Capture meals as they happen. Track what you ate, when, where, and how you felt. Add photos if you want. No calorie counting or restrictive rules—just awareness.

• Behavior Tracking
  Optionally track behaviors relevant to eating disorder recovery:
  - Perceived amount (too much, just right, unsure)
  - Exercise duration and intensity
  - Other patterns identified with your care team
  Simple checkboxes make tracking straightforward and judgment-free.

• Emotions & Context
  Note how you felt before and after eating. Track emotional states, physical sensations, and situational factors. Understanding context helps identify triggers and patterns.

• Daily Review Time
  Set a daily reminder to reflect on your entries. Review patterns without judgment. Notice what's working and what's challenging.

• Timeline View
  See your meal history at a glance. Spot patterns across days and weeks. Visual timeline helps you and your care team understand your progress.

• Care Team Support
  Add care team members (dietitians, therapists, doctors) to your profile. Export entries as PDFs to share with providers. Keep everyone on the same page.

PRIVACY YOU CAN TRUST

• ✓ All data stays on your device
• ✓ No account required
• ✓ No cloud sync or backups
• ✓ No tracking or analytics
• ✓ No advertising
• ✓ Encrypted at rest with iOS device encryption
• ✓ We can't access your data—even if we wanted to

Your meal data, feelings, and health information never leave your iPhone. We built Monitor this way intentionally because privacy matters, especially for sensitive health data.

WHY SELF-MONITORING MATTERS

Self-monitoring is a core component of eating disorder treatment and nutrition awareness. Research shows benefits include:

• Increased awareness of eating patterns and triggers
• Recognition of emotional connections to food
• Better communication with care providers
• Accountability without judgment
• Early identification of concerning behaviors

DESIGNED FOR RECOVERY

Monitor supports eating disorder recovery and mindful eating practices. Features are based on evidence-based treatment approaches:

• Non-judgmental tracking - No "good" or "bad" foods
• Behavior awareness - Recognize patterns without shame
• Emotional connection - Understand feelings around eating
• Provider collaboration - Easy sharing with care team

THIS IS NOT TREATMENT

Monitor is a self-monitoring tool, not a replacement for professional care. If you have a diagnosed eating disorder or are struggling with food and eating, please work with qualified providers. This tool works best as a supplement to professional treatment.

PERFECT FOR

• People in eating disorder recovery
• Anyone building mindful eating habits
• Therapy clients practicing between sessions
• Privacy-conscious users who want control over their health data
• People working with dietitians, nutritionists, or therapists

WHY WE BUILT THIS

Nutrition and eating data is incredibly sensitive. Yet most apps sync it to the cloud, create accounts, and track everything you do. We built Monitor because we believe your health data belongs to you—not to servers, not to companies, not to anyone else.

HONEST & TRANSPARENT

Monitor is a simple self-monitoring tool. We're transparent about what the app does (and doesn't do), and we'll never make exaggerated claims. This is a journal, not a cure.

Download Monitor and start tracking meals in complete privacy.

## SEO & Discovery Strategy

**App Store Optimization (ASO) Tips:**

1. **Title matters most**
   - Include "Meal Tracker" (highly searchable)
   - Less competitive than generic "nutrition app"
   - "Monitor" is unique, memorable

2. **Subtitle is secondary ranking**
   - "Privacy-first" differentiates from competitors
   - "nutrition tracking" is searchable

3. **Keywords drive search**
   - Don't repeat words from title/subtitle in keywords
   - Use all 100 characters
   - Focus on what users search for

4. **Description first 170 characters are critical**
   - Lead with unique value (privacy)
   - Front-load important keywords
   - Make it compelling

5. **Ratings & reviews boost ranking**
   - Encourage happy users to review
   - Respond to all reviews
   - Fix issues users mention

6. **Update regularly**
   - Frequent updates signal active development
   - Each update resets "What's New" to top
   - Can update promotional text anytime

---

## Localization (Future)

**v1.0:** English only

**Future considerations:**
- Spanish (large US market)
- French, German (Europe)
- Japanese (Asia)
- Portuguese (Brazil)

**What to localize:**
- App Store metadata (description, keywords, screenshots)
- In-app text (all UI strings)
- Educational content (distortion guides)
- Crisis resources (country-specific)

---

## Pricing

**Free** (no in-app purchases in v1.0)

**Future monetization options (if needed):**
- One-time purchase for Pro features ($4.99-$9.99)
- Donation/tip jar
- Export/backup features

**Why free:**
- Mental health tools should be accessible
- Build user base first
- Prove value before charging
- Privacy-first model reduces operating costs
